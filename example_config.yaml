  # macOS hides the real MAC address from BLE peripherals, and instead assign
  # discovered devices a UUID. This UUID is not guaranteed to be stable, but
  # in practice it doesn't seem to change frequently. You could find this
  # UUID and use it in place of the MAC address.
  # As an alternative, b-parasite encodes its own MAC address in its BLE
  # advertisement packet, so we can use that data instead. This is what happens
  # when `infer_mac_address` is set to `true`.
  # On Linux, none of this is necessary, since we have access to the real MAC
  # addresses of peripherals.

  # `registry` maps MAC addresses to devices' MQTT configuration. For now, the only

  # For example, for a device with name "Office parasite", the following topics will
  # be derived:
  # - parasite-scanner/sensor/office_parasite_soil_moisture/state
  # - parasite-scanner/sensor/office_parasite_temperature/state
  # - parasite-scanner/sensor/office_parasite_humidity/state
  # - parasite-scanner/sensor/office_parasite_battery_voltage/state
  # - parasite-scanner/sensor/office_parasite_rssi/state
